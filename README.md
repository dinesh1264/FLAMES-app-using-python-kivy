# FLAMES-app-using-python-kivy
Created this project while learning Kivy and KivyMD.
Anyone who is willing to do a basic beginner kivy program can use this for learning purposes.

Created a seperate .kv file for the User Interface design, also with the logic of the flames in the flames.py file.

Anyone who is willing to build their own flames app, can use this as reference and can also add new feature to it.

### Requirements:

* Python IDE.
* kivy.
* kivyMD.

* Make sure the 2 files are on the same folder.
